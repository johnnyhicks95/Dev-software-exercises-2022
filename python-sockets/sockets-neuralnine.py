""" from platform import architecture
Yher are structured by an OSI standard


Cliente server architecture
Sockets are the communication between two sides, usually client and 
server . Others are bluetooth

For Python we got "AF_INET6  -> Ipv4 o IPv6"
SOCK_STREAM: TCP [transmission control protocol],
reliable because detects , keeps up connection,
packet loss, conection bases, sequential.

SOCK_DGRAM: UDP [user datagram protocol]
Sends one datagram
No sequential, no order, no guarantee, REAL-TIME
IS more faster, less networj and PC stress

Skype:
A calls B by UDP, but secures the connection on TCP
